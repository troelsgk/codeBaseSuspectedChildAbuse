# codeBaseSuspectedChildAbuse
Code base for prospective analysis of 375 children with a suspicion of child abuse
This is the code underlying an analysis of 375 children examined for suspicion of child abuse. The code is written and commented within org-mode in the program Emacs and contains comments and R code. Will likely need access to Danish registries to replicate. Feel free to use and adapt!
